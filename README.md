Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive data-driven framework for analyzing vendor efficiency and profitability. By integrating SQL for data extraction and transformation, Python for statistical analysis, and Power BI for interactive visualization, we aim to support strategic decision-making in purchasing and inventory management within the retail sector.

The core objective is to move beyond simple sales reports and gain deep insights into the factors that drive profitability and operational efficiency across our vendor ecosystem. This allows us to make informed adjustments to pricing, promotions, and purchasing strategies.

This project evaluates vendor performance and retail inventory dynamics to drive strategic insights for purchasing, pricing, and inventory optimization. A complete data pipeline was built using SQL for ETL, Python for analysis and hypothesis testing, and Power BI for visualization.
